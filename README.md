# OrchidApp

OrchidApp is a learning and reference project for building, validating and version‑controlling a MySQL database schema in a professional, reproducible way.

The project treats the **database schema as source code**, with strict guarantees that:

- every committed schema can be rebuilt from scratch
- schema drift is detected immediately
- local development and CI behave the same way

This repository is intentionally opinionated and automation‑heavy. The automation is the contract.

---

## Core principles

1. **The live database schema is the authoritative source**  
   All schema changes are made in a database instance, not by editing SQL files.

2. **Schema files are generated artefacts**  
   Files under `database/schema/` are generated automatically and must never be edited manually.

3. **Git is the contract**  
   Anything committed to Git must be sufficient to rebuild the schema from scratch.

4. **Local validation mirrors CI**  
   What passes locally will pass in GitHub Actions, and vice versa.

---

## Mandatory setup (do this first)

After cloning the repository, you **must** run the setup script:

```powershell
pwsh scripts/setup.ps1
```

This step is not optional. It:

- verifies required tooling (PowerShell, Docker, MySQL client)
- configures Git to use the repository’s custom hooks (`.githooks/`)
- ensures schema validation runs automatically on every commit

Commits made without running this setup are invalid and will fail CI.

---

## Prerequisites (required)

The following applications and configuration are required to work on this repository. Commits and CI will fail if these requirements are not met.

### Applications

- **PowerShell 7 or later** (`pwsh`)
- **Git**, with support for custom hooks via `core.hooksPath`
- **Docker Desktop** (or equivalent Docker runtime). Docker must be running before committing or running local CI
- **MySQL client tools**, compatible with the target MySQL major version
- **VS Code**, general editor and Git integration

### Configuration

- Git must allow custom hooks (`core.hooksPath` is configured by `scripts/setup.ps1`)
- PowerShell execution policy must allow local script execution
- Docker must be available to the current user account

The setup script validates these prerequisites and will fail fast with clear errors if any are missing.

---

CI.

---

## Repository structure (high level)

- `database/schema/`  
  Generated SQL fragments representing the current database schema. **Do not edit manually.**

- `database/scripts/`  
  PowerShell scripts that export and assemble the schema in a deterministic way.

- `.githooks/pre-commit`  
  Enforces schema export and validation during every commit.

- `scripts/ci-local.ps1`  
  Runs the same schema build validation locally that CI runs in GitHub Actions.

---

## How schema changes work

1. Make schema changes directly in your local MySQL database
2. Commit your changes as normal
3. During commit, the pre‑commit hook will:
   - export the schema from the database
   - normalise and regenerate files under `database/schema/`
   - stage any updated schema files automatically
   - fail the commit if export or validation fails

The commit may modify files as part of this process. This is expected behaviour.

---

## Pre‑commit enforcement

The pre‑commit hook is a **hard gate**, not an advisory check.

- It mutates and stages generated schema files
- It prevents commits if schema export or validation fails
- Bypassing it (for example using `--no-verify`) is not permitted

Any commit that bypasses the hook will fail CI and be rejected.

## Database-only changes (important)

If you have made schema changes **only in the database**, Git may report that there are no file changes to commit.

This is expected.

In this project, schema files are generated by the **pre-commit hook**, not edited manually.  
Therefore, you must explicitly trigger a commit to allow the hook to run.

### Required procedure

When you have database-only changes:

1. Open **Git Bash** in the repository root
2. Confirm you are on the correct branch:

   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```
3. Confirm you are on the correct branch:

   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty
   ```
4. When the editor opens:

- Enter a clear commit summary
- Optionally include a detailed description

5. Save and exit the editor

   The pre-commit hook will then:

   - Export the schema from the database
   - Regenerate files under database/schema/
   - Stage those files automatically
   - Complete the commit with the generated artefacts included

**Notes**

   - Do not use --no-verify
   - Do not manually edit generated files

GitHub Desktop cannot perform this step; Git Bash is required

---

## Local CI validation

Before opening a pull request, you are expected to run:

```powershell
pwsh scripts/ci-local.ps1
```

This script:

- spins up a disposable MySQL instance using Docker
- rebuilds the schema using only committed files
- mirrors the GitHub Actions workflow exactly

If this script fails locally, CI will fail as well.

---

## Continuous integration

GitHub Actions runs a schema build validation on every push and pull request.

CI does **not** use your development database. It validates that:

- the committed schema can be assembled
- the schema can be built from scratch
- no ordering or dependency issues exist

This ensures long‑term reproducibility and prevents schema drift.

## What this project is (and is not)

This project is:

- a learning and reference implementation
- deliberately strict by design
- focused on correctness and reproducibility

This project is not:

- optimised for rapid prototyping
- tolerant of undocumented manual steps
- flexible about bypassing validation
